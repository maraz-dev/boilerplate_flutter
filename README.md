# boilerplate_flutter

A Flutter Boilerplate Project.

## Getting Started

This project is basically a SKELETON for Flutter projects instead of building from scratch.

> Change the **APP_NAME** in `app.dart`, `AndroidManifest.xml(Android)` and `project.pbxproj(iOS)`. You can easily run a **FIND AND REPLACE** to change the  **APP_NAME**.

### State Management
> The State management in this project is **Riverpod**, but you can easily change it if you want. **(Make sure to edit the `Dependency Injection` file)**.

### Project Name
Change the project name in `pubspec.yaml` from *boilerplate_flutter* to your *project_name*.

### Package Name
Change the project name in `AndroidManifest.xml(Android)` and `project.pbxproj(iOS)` from *com.example.boilerplate_flutter* to your *package_name*

> You can easily run a **FIND AND REPLACE** to change the `project_name` and the `package_name`
